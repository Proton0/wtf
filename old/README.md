# .WTF Old Versions

If you have projects that use old versions of the .WTF file format then you can use these


| WTF Version 	 | Package Version 	 | Support for archives? 	| Latest version 	 |
|---------------|:-----------------:|-----------------------	|------------------|
| 1.4         	 | 3               	 | yes                   	| yes            	 |
| 1.3         	 | 2               	 | yes                   	| no            	  |
| 1.0         	 | 1               	 | no                    	| no             	 |

Note: Package version 2 files are supported in package version 3+ converters

Package version 1 is not recommended to use because it doesn't support hash checks
